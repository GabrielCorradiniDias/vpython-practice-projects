# VPython Practice Projects

A collection of 3D simulations and visual experiments built using **VPython**.  
Each project focuses on exploring 3D visualization, animation, and physics-inspired design — including energy field models, object arrays, and creative visualizations.

## Projects Included

- **Cone Inside a Box** — A simple motion and collision simulation - First test with geometric primitives.
- **UFO Simulation** — A floating and rotating saucer with glowing lights.
- **Christmas Tree Scene** — A holiday-themed animated display with mountains and the moon and stars.
- **ZPF Array & Vacuum Chamber (WIP)** — Concept visualization of zero-point field interactions inside a vacuum setup.

## Note for Running the Simulations

These VPython projects work best when executed in **VS Code**.

**To run:**
1. Open the `.py` file in VS Code.
2. Make sure you have the `vpython` package installed:
   ```
   pip install vpython
   
3. Click Run Python File at the top-right of VS Code.

Running from a normal terminal (e.g., python file.py) might not display the 3D canvas correctly.

## Requirements

Python 3.10 or higher

VPython (pip install vpython)

Works best on Windows 10 or later

## About

These small projects are practice experiments for 3D visualization and scientific concept modeling using VPython.
They are meant as creative explorations and technical learning exercises.
